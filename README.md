# FORKIFY

## About the project
The forkify app is the final practice project in the vanilla javascript class I'm taking.
It will summarize everything I've learnt so far condensed into one project !

The project architecture follows the MVC pattern : the Model (data and business logic), the View (user interface), and the Controller (user input handling). This separation of concerns makes it easier to manage complexity, improve code reusability, and facilitate collaboration among developers.

The app uses the forkify API created by @jonasschmedtman : https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/v2

## Usage:
- Search recipes using a key word ingredient (e.g. "lemon", "chocolate", "garlic")
- Select a recipe and see the list of ingredients and their quantities
- Adjust the number of servings and the ingredients quantities will change accordingly
- Bookmark recipes, they will be stored into the browser's cache
- Quickly access bookmarked recipes through the list
